      "A medical claim verification and processing system reads a medical information card (MEDICARD) to determine a patient's background medical and insurance information. The validity of the card is rapidly determined by accessing a central brokerage computer. A local service provider enters into a local terminal the medical and MEDICARD information services provided or to be provided to the patient by using a patient service code and transmits this information to a central brokerage computer. The central brokerage computer converts the patient service code input by the service provider or MEDICARD into a particular service code for the patient's insurance carrier. This service code is then utilized to determine the insurance claim payment for that particular patient service. The claim payment amount for the medical service is then transmitted back to the local entry terminal for use by the service provider and patient. The service provider and patient can then determine the amount of payment which will be made for the particular insurance claim. The provider can then prepare an electronic claim form and, together with the patient's and/or the provider's determination whether or not the assignment provision of the insurance claim will be invoked, the electronic claim form is then transmitted to a central brokerage computer which in turn transmits the claim form to the appropriate insurance carrier. The patient's insurance carrier processes the claim form, and, based upon the assignment decision, transfers the payment check to the patient or makes an electronic funds transfer to an account for the service provider, the patient or a central brokerage computer.\n",

This healthcare system employs a preventive approach to healthcare by basing healthcare decisions on a multi-factorial computation of risk. The risk value is computed by evaluation of a function that considers a variety of historic, environmental, and systemic behaviors and conditions. In addition to considering a risk value, a treatment plan developed in accordance with the healthcare system considers symptoms and objectives of the treatment from the perspective of both the patient and the provider. The outcomes associated with treatment and risk assessment are fed back into the healthcare system to increase its accuracy and subsequent effectiveness in computing risk values over time.\n",

Entry of the EKG and/or CXR results prompts the creation of a separate lab record, if not already present, which may be holding blood work from the same lab test request. Portions of information entered in the EKG or CXR routine are automatically transferred to the separate lab record. Provision is made for linking the EKG or CXR records to the lab record in both \"source\" and \"non-source\" situations; a \"source\" situation meaning that the lab test request was made formally during an office visit, and a \"non-source\" situation meaning that the lab test request was made informally, such as by telephone. Two print generation programs pull together various linked data files and selectively print out information contained therein. The first prints out EKG and/or CXR data in conjunction with other clinical observations recorded at the primary care \"parent\" office visit. The second prints out specialist data in conjunction with other clinical observations recorded at the primary care \"parent\" office visit which prompted the referrals.
