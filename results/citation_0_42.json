  "abstract": "A method of assessing risk for an individual to experience a specific outcome within a disease entity within a specified time frame is provided. Peer-reviewed scientific publications are analyzed to identify pertinent risk factors (212) for developing disease processes and their possible complications. Information that characterizes an individual (218) in relation to the identified risk factors is then received, preferably responsive to question (224) regarding any demographic values of an individual under test and questions regarding medical chracterisitics of the individual under test. An estimate of risk of the individual acquiring the outcome within a specified time frame is performed based on the identified plurality of risk factors (212). Assessment of medical risk and condition may include analyzing peer-reviewed scientific publications to identify populations affected by a medical outcome and for each population respective risk factors that affect risk of acquiring the medical outcome within a specified time-frame, associating an individual with one of the identified population, identifying information that characterizes the individual (218) in relation to the respective risk factors other associated population, and estimating risk of the individual having the medical outcome within the specified the time frame responsive to the identified information. Promotion of business on a site of a computer network is provided by supplying an on-line questionnaire (224) regarding characteristics of individual (218) under test, receiving information regarding characteristics of the individual under test, and responsive to the received information, providing an assessment of the individual under test having a medical outcome within a specified time frame.",
