  "abstract": "A personal response system which provides speakerphone mode and emergency audio mode by controlling microphone sensitivity when audio signals fall below an acceptable level. Adjustable microphone sensitivity which can be controlled by the response center and/or by the help console itself. Emergency audio mode allows low level voices from outside the room the help console is in to be heard by allowing the response center to control the gradual raising or lowering the microphone sensitivity to vary the listening range of the microphone. A simultaneous increase in speaker volume allows response center personnel to converse with a disabled individual who cannot come to the help console. A second microphone and speaker in the personal transmitter permits two-way voice communication even when the individual is disabled outside of the dwelling and the help console is no longer effective.",
