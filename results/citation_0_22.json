A third population subset is created comprising members of the first population subset who are not members of the second population subset.

A third set of medical events associated with members of the second population subset is identified, each of the identified medical events having a specificity rating above the selected threshold. A fourth population subset is created from the third population subset, each member of the fourth population subset having associated therewith at least one medical event from the third set of medical events. The second and fourth population subsets are combined, thereby identifying members of the population having a specified disease state.",
