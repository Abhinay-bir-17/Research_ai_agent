    "45. A computer program product according to claim 35, wherein the computer program code for assessing a patient's risk of coronary heart disease is based on the detected presence of both an elevated LDL particle concentration and the determination of the metabolic abnormality and/or atherogenic dyslipidemia, and wherein the NMR based lipoprotein constituent values used to determine the presence of atherogenic dyslipidemia lack a LDL particle concentration value.",
    "46. A computer program product according to claim 45, further comprising computer program code for adjusting the risk associated with the predetermined test criteria based upon the existence of or susceptibility to an identified high-risk medical condition in the patient.",
    "47. A computer program product according to claim 35, further comprising computer program code for evaluating the lipoprotein measurement values and generating a patient-specific treatment guideline based on the presence or absence of predetermined risk criteria.",
    "48. A computer program product according to claim 47, wherein the computer program code for evaluating to generate specific treatment guideline considers selected parameters from both the patient's medical and behavioral history.",
    "49. A computer program product according to claim 47, wherein the computer program code for evaluating to generate specific treatment guideline considers whether the patient is diabetic.",
    "50. A computer program product according to claim 47, wherein the computer program code for evaluating to generate specific treatment guideline considers whether the patient has been diagnosed with CHD.",
    "51. A computer program product according to claim 35, further comprising computer program code for electronically generating the report and transmitting the report via email to a physician."
