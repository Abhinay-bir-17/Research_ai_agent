  "abstract": "A method of providing health care by establishing a predetermined patient population grouped by geographic regions where the patient population has access to a traveling healthcare professional that may travel to the patient's location. The healthcare professional evaluates and examines the patient using a plurality of technologies including a microprocessor and memory storage that is coupled to, or interfaced with, audio/video/data transfer and communications systems, medical devices, and other vital measurement devices that the physician located at the physicians' center uses to assess and consult the healthcare professional who is onsite with the remote patient. During the exam the healthcare professional uses audio/video/data communications for interconnecting the healthcare professional with a physician at the physicians' center. The physician at the physicians' center conducts a virtual house call to help maintain the physician-patient relationship, evaluate the collected information, and instruct the healthcare professional during the physician's examination and evaluation. The physician having access to the patient's health records, family medical history, present medications, prior allergic reactions and any adverse drug interactions or contraindications, assesses, and renders a diagnoses and treatment plan back to the healthcare professional. The healthcare professional under the delegation of the physician treats the patient under the physician's instructions. The physician may prescribe medication and transmit the prescription to a pharmacy. The physician updates the patient's health record with the collected information, diagnosis, physician orders, treatment plan, patient input information, and clinical notes. The method also provides for a patient to obtain medical information without the need for a healthcare professional's visit. The method also provides many illustrations that allow for the assessment, treatment, diagnosis, and sharing of medical information and care to be provided to the patient at the patient's location, and to authorized healthcare professionals.",
